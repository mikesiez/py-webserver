# py-webserver
### this repo contains the complete code and configs for a webserver I made to be a general-use website as well as a minecraft (any java game server works) server dashboard and a discord bot to go with it so users dont need to use the web dashboard (and more features that are secondary to the point of the repo). 

#### theres a lot of integrated features for security, ease of use, quick modification, etc.

### see `configs/README.md` for more in-depth description of some implemented tools.
